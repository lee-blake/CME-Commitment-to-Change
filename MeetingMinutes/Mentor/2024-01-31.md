## Topics Discussed

1. Current features and work in-progress features:
   - CSV file downloading
     - Keep it simple, try to stick to raw numbers without symbols most likely, which would make for better data manipulation by whoever downloads it. But it looks good and would be helpful.
   - Pie chart for statistics
     - Looks good, agreed with keeping the legend off to the side.
     - Could put legend off to side pointing into chart.
     - Could put percentage signs for slice labels, but that's it. Keep it simple.
   - Emailto: button
     - Looks good.
   - Cloud deployment
     - Email SES spam issue - we need to have a policy if people mark our emails as spam to get out of the SES sandbox
       - Adding an unsubscribe link to (non registration) emails so users can opt out
         - Keep a table of such blocked email & have a custom email backend wrapping Django's SMTP backend that checks against that table first
       - Require emails to be unique to limit registration spam abuse
         - Should prune accounts that do not get verified after some period (a week, a month, something customizable during deployment)
         - Alternatively, manual pruning is an option. Django admin site integration would be ideal but a simple script runnable by someone with deployment knowledge could be a good interim measure.
2. AWS deployment documentation:
   - Said it was pretty comprehensive and looked good.
   - Mentioned that at his work, they use a shell script that uses Git pull every 10 minutes or so. If certain files are changed, it will rebuild the database table. This could be useful in the future, but for now it's not something to worry about.

## Things Clarified

1. Suggested adding a "pledge" to sign when creating an account for the site. Maybe a privacy policy? Should ask Kurt about this.
2. Overall impressions: 
   - Jake said that while our features are lacking a bit, he still thinks Kurt will probably be impressed with what we have, mainly because of our cloud deployment. 
   - The charts and graphs will help as well. If there's any small features we can add to pad it out a bit more, try to do that.
   - As far as grading goes, we may lose some points due to the lack of major features, but considering our team size we should be okay.
