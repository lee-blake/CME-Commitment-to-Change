## Topics Discussed
1. Discussed features currently being worked on/completed
    - Cancel all reminder emails
    - Share to Twitter
    - Students next to commitments
    - Scheduled reminder emails 
2. Discussed presenting early with the client - what is the best approach to dealing with this?
    - Big features before the meeting, show smaller QoL stuff later through screenshots or (better yet) documentation + AWS.
3. Other stuff that would be good candidates to get done - complete aesthetics changes desired, plus round out CRUD options


## Things Clarified
1. Autoscheduler strategy, displayed in a second area on the page, is best for scheduling emails, rather than scheduling a batch on creation.
2. Next meeting tenatively 6pm Apr 5
    - If rescheduled, Jake is unavailable Apr 12-15
