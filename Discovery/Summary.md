# Discovery Meeting Summary

This file contains a more detailed summary of what project information was gathered in the [discovery meeting](Minutes.md).

## Technical

1. The project should be developed with an eye for cloud deployment - while Stanford does have capable web servers, the client would prefer to avoid the setup and potential scaling issues.

2. Developing as a web app is preferred so long as the site is responsive on mobile. A mobile application may be a a late goal or post-turnover of the project.

3. The client has no preference for tech stack so long as the above points can be met with it.

4. The client was happy with the rough suggestion for progression: Login -> Simple profile -> Commitments -> Provider commitments -> Course commitments. The intention of this is to develop into course commitments as quickly as possible while still providing functionality along the way.

## Project Goals

1. The most important objective of the project is to enable clinicians in CME to make and keep commitments related to CME. 

2. Another important objective of the project is to enable CME providers to examine the successfulness at courses in helping clinicians meet their commitments. This involves gathering and displaying comparisons of data both between different courses in the same provider and similar courses between different providers.

3. When the two goals above conflict, it is more important to enable the clinicians to make and meet commitments. The client specifically mentioned not placing too many requirements on making a commitment because the more there are, the fewer clinicians will actually make a commitment.

## Users

1. The expected number of users early is quite small, but the project should be readily scalable (cloud deployment can help with this).

2. Both individuals (clinicians) and organizations (CME providers) are expected to use the platform. Verification of CME providers is possible, but it is impractical and counterproductive to verify clinicians.

3. Any given clinician may be tied to multiple CME providers as there are many such providers offering courses. We cannot tie each clinician to a single provider.

## Commitments

1. Commitments do *correlate* with SMART goals, but the client cautioned against *requiring* that they be SMART goals because more effort in creating a commitment discourages creation.

2. Commitments may be pass/fail or may have partial success. The client gave the example of a weight loss goal of 10 lbs. If one only lost 8 lbs by the deadline, they would only have 80% completed it. However, it would not necessarily be a failure either.

3. Commitments may exist in the context of a CME course, an invidiual clinician's goal, or a group of clinicians with similar goals. However, the client indicated that commitments in groups are better than individual ones - because of the ability to ask for help - and that CME course commitments are best of all both because of help and because the analytics from those commitments may help improve courses in the future.

4. The mechanism where a clinician who is struggling with a commitment can seek input/help is important. The mechanism was not specified by the client in detail, but based on the proposal, comments on commitments may be a good place to start. Further clarification with the client will be important.

## External Entities (CME Providers & Social Media)

1. It should be easy to share a commitment on social media. The client mentioned that Twitter is the preferred first site for this.

2. The client has mentioned that as the project develops, Stanford CME may share it with other providers. They are more interested in getting the data to improve CME and in enabling clinicians to meet commitments than in making money off the site.

3. The client strongly suggested examining how other goal-setting sites work as part of the research process.
