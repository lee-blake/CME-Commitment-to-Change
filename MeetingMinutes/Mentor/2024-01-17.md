## Topics Discussed

1. Went through and discussed our proposed features for this iteration with Jake.
2. Specifically discussed cloud deployment. 
3. Jake Liked our focus on statistics this iteration, and agreed this would impress our client.
4. Jake recommended we try to add some nice looking graphs to display the data and statistics we collect, and suggested using Syncfusion or D3.js for this. He also suggested we start thinking about how we could gamify some of our data/statistics in the future.


## Things Clarified

1. For cloud deployment SMTP, start simple, and try using free services first, then we can expand to other options if necessary. Google's SMTP service was recommended, but it's worth noting that exceeding their daily limit for messages will result in a ban. We should look into ways to avoid this.
2.  We plan to try and add some graphs and charts to our project with the suggested libraries Jake recommended.
