## Topics Discussed

1. Documentation:
    - Need to finish documentation tasks.
    - Need to make a default troubleshooting guide for restarting the database.

2. Frontend tasks that need finished
    - Switch to Bootstrap for styling where possible

    - Navbar:
        - Login information should be anchored to the right
        - Styling could be adjusted 
        - Request current url to determine active nav with Django or Javascript

    -  Dashboard styling:
        - Each commitment should show Title, date due (Month - day, or if within the month, it will say how many days are left), and complete and discontinue. 
        - Complete and discontinue buttons need stylized. Maybe a checkbox and X?
        - Possibility that in the future, clicking a complete button may not redirect to the commitment you're editing, but will stay on the dashboard.

    - Forms:
        - Register for clinician errors should be highlighted.
        - Add a cancel button to any form where revelant.

    - Commitment View: 
        - Add commitment editing buttons.
        - Adjust the styling for editing buttons.

3. Testing:
    - Need to test more and try to break things.

4. New possible features for this iteration:
    - Add super basic group pages
    - Create invitation link for courses
