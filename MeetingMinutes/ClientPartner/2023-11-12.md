## Topics Discussed

1. Demoed the software to the client via Zoom's Remote Control feature.
    - The client interacted directly with the software.
2. Discussed next iteration features.
3. Briefly reviewed User.md for clarity.

## Things Clarified

1. Lots of feedback regarding the software, see [Feedback](#feedback).
2. Meeting next Sunday is unlikely, but if we are to do so, notify by Wednesday. We would also need to meet before 4pm EST or much later in the night as our client is attending a sporting event that day.
3. We will be keeping the Commitment-to-Change-App repo private for now, and can revisit this in the future.

## Feedback
- General:
    - Get more data on individuals and institutions (fill out profiles) and on length of course names:
        - Some of this information can be found on the [Stanford CME website](https://med.stanford.edu/cme).
        - Our client will also be giving us more detailed information in Slack.

- Courses and related commitments:
    - Student privacy for course pages. Two solutions proposed by the client are:
        - Students enrolled in a course can opt out of displaying their name and commitment in the course page.
        - Could show a popup, warning the student that their name will be associated with their commitment on the course page. (Less ideal, but easier to implement as an emergency backup plan).
    - Course names will likely be lengthy, be sure to accommodate that.
    - Consider adding optional date(s) for course period.
    - Copy to clipboard button for invite link.
    - Provider's name should be displayed on course page.
    - Feedback/suggestions from providers for how to complete commitments .
    - Statistics for 'suggested' commitments.
    - Improve sending out course invite links; consider email automation.
    - When a clinician joins a course, tell them that join was successful and suggest next steps.
    - Enable providers to add a message for clinicians when they join the course.
    - Downloading the results.
    - Archiving courses, possibly automatically by course dates.
    - Sorting courses in the provider dashboard.
    - Providers have a unique identifier associated with their courses (like a class or section number).
    - Providers should be able to copy-edit a course (advanced feature).
    
- Account creation/features:
    - Clinicians may optionally choose to have an institution associated with them.
    - Add name field for provider accounts.
    - Forget password page.


## Priorities for second iteration
- Cloud deployment
- Mobile device support, especially for clinician side of UI
- Profile fields for learner and provider
- Forget password page
- Header info, making it clear which provider is giving a course
- Documentation help pages and help links to those
