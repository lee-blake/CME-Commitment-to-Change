# Business Requirements

- **BR1: The software behind the application should support the growing field of CME without intervention from the client.**
  - A facet that was implied when talking about an application to support numerous clinicians and CME providers was the fact that the amount 
  of people using the application could go from tens or hundreds of users to thousands along the life of the application. Creating a modular
  application that can be easily changed to support more users is a defining requirement behind the application.
  

- **BR2: Improve application of CME by getting clinicians to make clear commitments to positively change their delivery of medical care.**
  - Clinicians are typically asked to make a commitment to change to utilize the information presented in the CME courses they take. These
  commitments hold weight and have the opportunity to affect the quality of the medical care that can be delivered through these commitments.
  These commitments are one of the most important things that clinicians can do after taking a course through a CME provider.
  

- **BR3: Help keep clinicians motivated to stick to the commitments they make.**
  - Commitments clinicians make can be difficult to follow through with. Whether it be the goal is cumbersome or the commitment not defined well
  enough, clinicians need a way to be reminded about the commitments they make to hold them accountable to these commitments. The goal is to 
  get more commitments made and completed by these reminders. 
  
  
- **BR4: Promote a community that allows both clinicians and CME providers to connect the education they deliver to the commitments clinicians make.**
  - CME providers want to stay engaged with clinicians during and after a CME course, and by allowing this connection after a course,
  CME providers can directly communicate this course related information through the commitments clinicians make as an individual but also
  through the commitments made as a group under a specific course. Not only is this the mission of CME providers to provide a channel for
  learning but it also keeps clinicians engaged in the education they receive by implementing it in their everyday roles.
  

- **BR5: Provide a means for clinicians to get assistance in meeting their commitments.**
  - Receiving help on the commitments clinicians create for themselves is as important as initially creating the commitment. Clinicians and
  CME providers should be able to lend help to one another by making the landscape surrounding commitments  a social gathering. Offering a 
  platform for this uplifting communication is an essential part in clinicians successfully keeping to commitments they made.
  

- **BR6: Enable clinicians to visually track progress for their commitments.**
  - Each commitment made is a goal; a promise that clinicians make to uphold the lessons learned through their CME courses. The 
  commitments they make should be ones that can be tracked and can show to the commitment maker their progress to their goal. Having a 
  way to show the milestones clinicians have met throughout their commitment makes these commitments more attainable and answers the
  question of _how much longer until I reach my goal_.
  

- **BR7: Enable CME providers to compare the effectiveness between their courses at effecting change through clinician commitments.**
  - A metric that is incredibly helpful for CME providers is one that shows the effectiveness of the courses that they teach. As this is
  not something that is easily measured, a good way to justify this effectiveness is through the commitments that clinicians make and
  keep after going through a CME course. CME providers want this information so that they can adjust the courses that perform less
  effectively and learn what makes a course effective to the clinicians they teach.
  

- **BR8: Enable CME providers to compare the effectiveness of their courses to similar courses offered by other providers.**
  - A metric that helps the CME providers compare effectiveness in their courses in one area or location would also help CME providers
  in other areas just as well. Not only would CME providers be able to see commitments set and made locally, but they could also look
  at similar courses and compare their effectiveness with their own. CME providers can then talk to each other and get feedback on
  what is effective and what could be improved on in their own courses.
  
- **BR9: Provide a safe and respectable environment for clinicians and CME providers to communicate and connect in.**
  - Safety amongst the community that wishes to improve themselves through making commitments and connections to one another
  should be evident on the platform. This includes safeguarding accounts and account information, moderation of inappropriate
  content, and controls disposable to the user to protect them from other malicious users.
