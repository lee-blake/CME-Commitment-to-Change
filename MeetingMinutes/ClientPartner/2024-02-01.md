## Client Use of the Project
### How did the client use the software?

Kurt checked out our new features from his browser on our AWS instance.
North guided him through the features.

### What features did they test in your software?
- (implicitly) cloud deployment
- Mailto link
- Course commitments csv download
- Pie charts
- Commitment template stats
- Aggregate course stats
- New theme


### How long did they use your software?
16:15-16:26

### How was their reaction to the software?

Overall, he seemed happy and felt it was an improvement. We received positive feedback about each feature and also received some suggestions for improvment on some of them. Based on what he said and did not say, he seemed to think our main issues were in usability rather than functionality.


### Did you recognize anything unusual/different/good/bad?
Liked the download icons
Liked the pie charts
One decimal point is enough
New, darker red theme is an improvement
Add percentage columns to csv

### Issues (any usability, functionality, etc issues)

Fontawesome didn't render on Kurt's Mac/Chrome setup
Download button for aggregate stats needs to stand out more
Clarify which page you're on 
Suggestion: mass emails by selection


## Priorities for fourth iteration
Kurt asked to defer decision on whether to commit to domain name, etc. stuff for broader deployment. He did not have any functionality priorities in the interim - his biggest concerns seemed to be the usability issues we discussed above.
