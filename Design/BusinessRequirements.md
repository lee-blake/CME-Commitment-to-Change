# Business Requirements

- BR1: Improve application of CME by both getting clinicians to agree to and keep commitments to change.
  - This is the most fundamental need the software is meant to address. Every software requirement in both the proposal and the discovery meeting, excluding deployment requirements, has been focused on meeting this goal in some manner. The client has also explicitly stated this requirement early in the meeting when discussing the high-level goals of the project. As such, it is fair to say that it is a business requirement because it is a need that the software is meant to address.

- BR2: Determine which CME courses are and are not effective at changing care delivery by clinicians.
  - In the discovery meeting and project proposal, the client discusses how most of the commitments should take place in the context of a CME course, such as committing to apply specific lessons learned from a course. When combined with the requirement in the proposal that data on commitments be gathered and displayed, it is clear that gathering data for commitments related to CME courses is a high priority. The goal of this, as discussed in the discovery meeting, is to allow CME providers to compare their courses to similar ones offered by other providers and to other courses they themselves offer to figure out what is working and what is not. In other words, one of the needs behind a major feature of the platform is to gather data on the relative effectiveness of courses at effecting successful commitments to change. As such, this is a business requirement.
