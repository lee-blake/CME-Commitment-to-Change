## Topics Discussed

1. Standup meeting - stuff finished, stuff planned, roadblocks
2. North demoed a fix to a UI issue in our Course page that involved changing the DOM
3. Discussed switching some unicode icons to Bootstrap icons to fix another UI bug
4. Discussed docker/host differences maybe causing djlint to miss the rcfile
5. Discussed extracting some element duplication across all of our main pages

## Things Clarified

1. Reach out to the client about the meeting he missed Sunday
    - Get his phone number so we can text him a reminder if he is missing
2. We both prefer 2-space indents for djlint auto-formatting.

## Work Done

1. Finished most screenshots & writeup for UI Evaluation.
2. Reviewed & merged a PR for our frontend.
