  - Clinicians  are physicians and practicioners that use the platform to make and keep commitments. In most, but not all, cases, they will be in some form of continuing medical education (CME).
- CME Providers
  - CME providers are the organizations that deliver CME courses. They use the platform to enable commitments related to their courses by clinicians. CME providers are accredited and are much easier to verify than individual clinicians. CME providers are also entire organizations that may run many courses with large numbers of clinicians as students.
