## Feedback


- New modals for commitment operations look great
- Help modals are good and we can ask the client for help on the language
for those
- Fix commitment description displaying on one line
- Wondered about our email registration - if it sends an email (it does)
- Considerations around provider instutitions
  - Suggestion: dropdown menu with all providers in the country could be an option
  - Only want one account for each provider
    - Verify the providers
    - Verification could send an email when provider registers
- Stacking on course page is confusing, change the headers around
- Editable suggested commitments could give wrong data if edited too much
  - No editing would be a better default
- Really like the suggested commitments
- Username display in courses isn't really relevant
- Forgot password feature is really great
- Features are all great improvements
- Client can help if we need actual graphics
- Client has access to Google cloud services

### Functionality notice

- We asked the client if he would use the new features in production
  - He answered with a very firm yes, all of the features were usable, helpful,
  and helped satisy his goals 
- We asked the client if he would use the software as-is right now if
development budget stopped
  - He said that the current features and views of the software were basic
  enough that he would probably not
  - However, when asked, also additionally noted that he liked the features we
  have so far and are making very good progress.
    


## Priorities for third iteration

- Cloud deployment with a link passed to the client
- Need more statistics for the provider 
  - Being able to download excel files with statistics would be good
- Some way for providers to interact with clinicians
  - Maybe send an email?
- Options for clinician automated reminders
- Ways for providers to link resources
  - At the course level is preferred
- More fields for courses 
  - Learning objectives of the course
    - Maybe a "make another commitment in this course" button showing
    the learning objectives?
  - Link to the course page at the provider level
