## Topics Discussed
1. Standup meeting - stuff finished, stuff planned, roadblocks.
2. Discussed delaying merging the course template reformat PR until tomorrow in case Kris shows up to class. Since there is overlap between the course reformat and Kris's feature, we will need to discuss that with him.
3. Found bug in statistics page and made up an Issue on Github. When no data is attatched to a commitment template or course, the statistics table will display "%" for each status, which looks ugly. We should make it display consistently ("0.0%").

## Things Clarified
1. 

## Work Done
1. Finished reviewing some template refactor PRs
2. Made issue for bug
3. Worked on cleaning client meeting minutes
