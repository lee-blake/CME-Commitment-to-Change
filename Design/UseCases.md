# Actors

- Administrators
  - Administrators are appointed by the owner of the platform to manage it.
- Clinicians
  - Clinicians  are physicians and practicioners that use the platform to make 
and keep commitments. In most, but not all, cases, they will be in some form of 
continuing medical education (CME).
- CME Providers
  - CME providers are the organizations that deliver CME courses. They use 
the platform to enable commitments related to their courses by clinicians. 
CME providers are accredited and are much easier to verify than individual 
clinicians. CME providers are also entire organizations that may run many 
courses with large numbers of clinicians as students.
- CME educators
  - CME educators are the professionals that teach CME courses. They are part 
of a CME provider organization.
