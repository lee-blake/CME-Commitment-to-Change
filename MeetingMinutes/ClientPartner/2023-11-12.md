## Feedback

- Course names will likely be lengthy, be sure to accomodate that.
- Students enrolled in a course can opt-out of displaying their name and commitment in the course page. 
- Consider adding optional date(s) for course period
- Copy to clipboard button for invite link
- Names for provider accounts
- Clinicians may have an institution associated with them
- Feedback/suggestions from providers for how to complete commitments 
- Statistics for 'suggested' commitments
- Improve sending out links; consider email automation
- Got to Stanford CME to figure out length of course names
- Get more data on individuals and institutions (fill out profiles)
- On join course, tell them that join was successful and suggest next steps
- Forget password page
- Enable providers to add a message for clinicians when they join the course
- Downloading the results
- Archiving courses, possibly automatically by course dates
- Sorting courses in the provider dashboard
- Providers have a unique identifier associated with their courses (like a class or section number)
- Providers should be able to copy-edit a course (advanced feature)

## Priorities for second iteration
- Cloud deployment
- Mobile device support, especially for clinician side of UI
- Profile fields for learner and provider
- Forget password page
- Header info, making it clear which provider is giving a course
- Documentation help pages and help links to those
