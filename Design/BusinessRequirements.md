# Business Requirements

- **BR1: Improve patient care by holding clinicians accountable for the education they receive through CME courses.**
  - I'm not actually sure this one meets the characteristics of excellent requirements (which the professor
  - mentioned as necessary for business requirements on 10/05). See "verifiable". -Lee
  

- **BR2: Improve application of CME by getting clinicians to make clear commitments to positively change their delivery of medical care.**
  - CME providers have courses that clinicians can attend to continue their medical education outside of university gates. These courses
  that clinicians attend teach new medical practices or procedures in the ever-changing world of the medical field. The clinicians are
  typically asked to make a commitment to change to utilize the information presented in these CME courses to hold them accountable to make
  a positive change in the medical care they give. These commitments hold weight and have the opportunity to affect the quality of medical
  care that can be delivered through these commitments.  
  

- **BR3: Help keep clinicians motivated to stick to the commitments they make.**
  - Through the use of game-like elements, notifications, and a user-based system; clinicians can make commitments with a user profile
  alongside many other users. These commitments are goals that each clinician sets for themselves and can also include sub-goals to make
  the commitment attainable to complete. By getting notified about the commitments made and by physically posting them to individual
  profiles, clinicians are enabled with the tools to stay on top of the commitments they make. 
  
  
- **BR4: Promote a community that allows both clinicians and CME providers to connect the education they deliver to the commitments clinicians make.**
  - CME providers want to stay engaged with clinicians during and after a CME course, and by allowing this connection after a course,
  CME providers can directly communicate this course related information through the commitments clinicians make as an individual but also
  through the commitments made as a group under a specific course.
  

- **BR5: Provide a means for clinicians to get assistance in meeting their commitments.**
  - Clinicians making and keeping commitments is the main goal for CME providers, and giving or receiving help should be as important as
  initially creating the commitment. Clinicians should be able to lend help to one another by making the landscape surrounding commitments 
  a social gathering. Offering a platform for this uplifting communication is an essential part in clinicians successfully keeping to
  commitments they made.
  

- **BR6: Enable clinicians to visually track progress for their commitments.**
  - Each commitment made is a goal; a promise that clinicians make to uphold the lessons learned through their CME courses. The 
  commitments they make should be ones that can be tracked and can show to the commitment maker their progress to their goal. Having a 
  way to show the milestones clinicians have met throughout their commitment makes these commitments more attainable and answers the
  question of _how much longer_.
  

- **BR7: Enable CME providers to compare the effectiveness between their courses at effecting change through clinician commitments.**
  - A metric that is incredibly helpful for CME providers is one that shows the effectiveness of the courses that they teach. As this is
  not something that is easily measured, a good way to justify this effectiveness is through the commitments that clinicians make and
  keep after going through a CME course. CME providers want this information so that they can adjust the courses that perform less
  effectively and learn what makes a course effective to the clinicians they teach.
  

- **BR8: Enable CME providers to compare the effectiveness of their courses to similar courses offered by other providers.**
  - A metric that helps the CME providers compare effectiveness in their courses in one area or location would also help CME providers
  in other areas just as well. Not only would CME providers be able to see commitments set and made locally, but they could also look
  at similar courses and compare their effectiveness with their own. CME providers can then talk to each other and get feedback on
  what is effective and what could be improved on in their own courses.
  
- **BR9: Provide a safe and respectable environment for clinicians and CME providers to communicate and connect in.**
  - Safety amongst the community that wishes to improve themselves through making commitments and connections to one another
  should be evident on the platform. This includes safeguarding accounts and account information, moderation of inappropriate
  content, and controls disposable to the user to protect them from other malicious users.
