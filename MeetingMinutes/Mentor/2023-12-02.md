3. Asked about strategies for future iteration features

## Things Clarified

1. Client meeting is tomorrow at 3pm Eastern.
2. Remaining features: client profile fields, copy to clipboard, show password

## Mentor Feedback

1. Static files should be split up. CSS in one folder, JS in another, etc.
2. Modularity work will basically all be in the model layer because Django
dictates a lot of the higher structure. Make as much possible in that layer
non-Django-specific.
3. Block out features for an iteration week by week when figuring out
next-iteration features. 
4. Expect a good number of features to be new stuff furthering the business
requirements. Some other quality of life stuff can be added, but is generally
of lower priority.
5. Plan for worst-case scenarios around team member availability.
6. Add more help pages, they look good.
7. Docstring should follow many of the same rules as comments.
8. Software looks ready for the client.
