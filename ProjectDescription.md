# Project Description

## Summary

On the website, clinicians make commitments to change their medical practice based on what they have learned in a continuing medical education (CME) course. We represent these commitments with a short title and longer description, as a deadline to create definitive end states. We also track whether commitments are past their deadlines, completed, or simply discontinued indefinitely. 

The vast majority of commitments should occur as part of a course on the site. The course does not include the instructional material itself. Instead, it offers CME providers a way to organize clinicians according to a course they offer, so that they may be working for similar goals of changing practice according to the course learning objectives. Providers may invite students with a link and may suggest commitments within each course to give some good directions for clinicians to take, but clinicians are still free to make their own unique commitments within the courses.

The website ends up serving two functions. One, it helps to motivate clinicians to both clarify and fulfill their commitments. We use deadlines, reminders, sharing on social media, and provider interaction with clinicians to create pressure for clinicians to work on their commitments. Two, the site allows providers to gather statistics on whether their courses change medical practice. In many case, a course may teach the learning objectives very well but may not be successful at getting clinicians to behave differently. By measuring whether these commitments to change are completed or not, we give providers a tool to analyze which courses are being applied well and which are not.
