## Topics Discussed

1. Modularity of Django projects.
2. Meeting times before the end of the iteration
3. Small changes to the project board
4. Distribution of tasks

## Things Clarified

1. For the development of our application, modularity is based on how and what can be tested in singularity.
   As Django development is based on multiple separate models and views files, these can have dependency upon each other.
2. Meeting times for our client and mentor need to be scheduled tentatively within the next week and a half.
   Planned time for our mentor meeting is 6:00pm Friday, 11/24/2023. Expected planned time for the client meeting is ~6:00pm Sunday, 11/3/2023.
3. The implementation of institution names for CME provider accounts has been updated to reflect that these are required
   and not optional unlike the clincian accounts.

## Tasks assigned

- [See project board for tasks assigned](https://github.com/users/lee-blake/projects/1)
  - Tasks revolve around testing, adding modals, and modifications to the fields of the commitment and CME accounts.
