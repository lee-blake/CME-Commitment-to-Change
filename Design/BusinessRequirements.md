# Business Requirements

- **BR1: Motivate and enable clinicians to make and keep commitments to enact positive change in the practice of medicine.**
  - Except for data-gathering requirements, virtually every feature mentioned
    in the proposal and the discovery meeting focuses on getting clinicians to
    make and keep commitments. The reason for this is that three things are
    necessary for changes in medical practice: education, the desire to change,
    and the commitment to see that change through. At the end of a CME course,
    the first two can be assumed to be present (the desire to change can be assumed
    from the enrollment and attendance of the course itself). Thus, this requirement
    is a realization of the fundamental need that motivates the project, with the
    sole distinction that the commitments in the project itself are made public.
    Thus, it is a business requirement.

- **BR2: Enable CME providers to measure the relative effectiveness of their courses at creating changes in medical practice by their respective students.**
  - In the discovery meeting and project proposal, the client discussed how 
    most of the commitments should take place in the context of a CME course, 
    such as committing to apply specific lessons learned from a course. When 
    combined with the requirement in the proposal that data on commitments be 
    gathered and displayed, it is clear that gathering data for commitments 
    related to CME courses is a high priority. The goal of this, as discussed 
    in the discovery meeting, is to allow CME providers to compare their 
    courses to similar ones offered by other providers and to other courses 
    they themselves offer to figure out what is working and what is not. In 
    other words, one of the needs behind a major feature of the platform is to 
    gather data on the relative effectiveness of courses at effecting 
    successful commitments to change. As such, this is a business requirement.
