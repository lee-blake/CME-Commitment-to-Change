# Summary
<!--- Describe what this PR will change -->

# Feature/Issue
<!--- Link to the feature/issue that this PR is related to. GitHub will automatically create a link between your issue/PR if you use the following syntax:

Resolves [issue-path]

***NOTE: Since this is on the planning repo, 'Resolves' should be rare. You 
should generally use something like 'Part of [issue-path]' unless it's a 
documentation-specific issue.***

- If the issue and PR are in the same repository, just use [#issue-number] for the [issue-path]
  - For example: Resolves #35

- If the issue is in a different repository, use [repository-owner-name/repository-name#issue-number] for the [issue-path]
  - For example: Resolves lee-blake/CME-Commitment-to-Change#35

If your PR only makes partial progress on the feature/issue, use something like:

Part of [issue-path]

DO NOT use an actual URL for the [issue-path]. If you do, GitHub will not correctly link the issue to your PR.

If there's not a corresponding feature/issue, either make one if that makes sense or note why this change is worth making.

## Do not merge immediately
<!--- If you do not want someone to merge these changes ASAP (when the 
respective code PR is merged or immediately if no such PR), note it here and 
explain why. -->

# Checklist
