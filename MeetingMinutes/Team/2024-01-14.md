## Topics Discussed

1. Sent out a When2Meet to schedule mid-iteration mentor Zoom meeting, due Friday, January 19th.
2. Troubleshooted Kris's Development environment and made sure the code and Pytest run correctly.
3. Discussed some of the next iteration grading rubric.
   - Docker: Our current replication is up to date and shouldn't need updating as of now.
   - Testing:
     - We're in a pretty good spot, but we could do with adding more. 
     - Template test should be added. Any logic in a template that is not tested in the view layer, we should test in a template test.
     - Any new code added should be tested at each level that was changed (model, template, etc.)
   - Modularity: 
   - Clean code: Templates should be double checked to make sure there's no redundant or unclean code.
4. Discussed and assigned tasks for Kris:
   - Delete courses and create commitment/commitment template HIPAA checkbox
  
## Things Clarified

1. We plan to meet in-person once a week as a team to work on the project and code as a group. Depending on what we're working on, we may meet more, or have a virtual meeting to check in on what everyone is working on. 
2. Need to message Kurt and ask about the missed meeting, and find a better way to confirm meeting times
