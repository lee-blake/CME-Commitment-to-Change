## Reflection
Reflections from team members on the symposium are included here.

### Lee
A couple things stood out to me during our presentation at the symposium. First, it was easy to present the project effectively after presenting many times to the client and our classmates. Second, our choices on the presentation poster definitely affected how clearly we could explain things. Having both the course and provider statistics pages made it possible to visually illustrate the two uses of the site. However, it would have been easier if we had the course page from the clinician perspective, as could have shown instead of told. Finally, we were lucky to have good, active listeners. While we spent most of the symposium wait for audience members rather than presenting, those who listened made it clear they were interested and that was very easy to work with.
