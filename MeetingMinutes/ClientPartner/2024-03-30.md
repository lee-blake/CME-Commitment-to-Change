## Topics Discussed
1. Extra client meeting times since this iteration's due date was extended an extra week.
2. Email subject and body wording. Still waiting on Kurt to work on this and get back to us.
3. Social media sharing.
   - Could add Facebook, linkedIn, or other social media.
   - Kurt will get back to us on what image to use for the preview, as well as default tweet wording (hashtags, @ing Stanford's CME account, etc.)
   - We should look for a Django filter to allow our twitter href in our template to not use %20. This would lead to greater code readability.

## Things Clarified
1. We plan to meet with Kurt on Saturday, April 13th at 11:45am EST / 8:45am PST.
2. We will be meeting in person Monday, April 1st at 1pm EST in the collab room.
